  We've intercepted the correspondances of two secret 
  agents, and we believe there's some sort of flag hidden 
  within. Please decrypt their conversation, as it is 
  obviously of much importance.<br />

hint: We also have reason to believe that one of the key agents here isn't the brightest.<br />SHIET I completely forgot, both of the agents' Shift and Caps Lock keys are broken. They mashed their keyboards together for a high-104 after they solved a Caesar problem last CTF. Maybe that will help you.
