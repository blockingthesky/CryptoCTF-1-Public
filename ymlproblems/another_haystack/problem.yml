  Back in the old days, all the hackers communicated with 
  ridiculously complex ciphers and haystacks. This lasted, 
  of course, only as long as the government couldn't break 
  their messages. The subject matter of this haystack must 
  never have been intercepted by government, else the activities 
  being discussed would have been terminated long ago. Do what 
  the dumb NSA was unable to do, and figure out what message 
  lies in this haystack.<br />
  Ctrl-F will serve you well.<br />
